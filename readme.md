This is Tic Tac Toe!
created by ryan manchester, using ruby (without rails).
This program is meant to be played in the bash terminal,
against another human player at this stage.
In this project i have bean learning to apply
OOP principles (Object - oriented Design) using classes,
and practicing applying access / viewability on an need to know
basis - i never know who might try to play with the codebase!
thanks, ryan.
